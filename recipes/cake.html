    <p>This carrot cake is quick, easy to make, and utterly delicious. It wasn’t until recently that we realized just how much we love carrot cake.
         It wasn’t something either of us grew up eating. Thanks to this easy recipe, we fell in love.
         You can make this cake quickly without lots of fancy equipment. Not only is this the best-tasting carrot cake we’ve made, but it’s a cinch to make.</p>
    <p>This is my favorite recipe for carrot cake! It is 100% made from scratch, easy to make, versatile, and utterly delicious. One of our most popular recipes!
         Just read all the rave reviews! </p>
    <h2 class="headings">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups (295 ml) canola or other vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="black">Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper 
            then grease the top of the paper. Or, grease and flour the bottom and sides of both pans.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt, and the cinnamon until well blended</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the oil, sugars, and vanilla. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, until combined.</li>
        <li>Switch to a large rubber spatula. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then add the dry ingredients in 3 parts, 
            gently stirring until they disappear and the batter is smooth. Stir in the carrots, nuts, and raisins.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans. Bake until the tops of the cake layers are springy when touched and 
            when a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool cakes in pans for 15 minutes then turn out onto cooling racks, peel off parchment paper and cool completely. 
            (If you find that a cake layer is stuck to the bottom of the pan, leave the cake pan upside down and allow gravity to do its thing).</li>
    </ol>
